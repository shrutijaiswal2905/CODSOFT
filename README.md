# CodSoft - AI Internship

# TASK-1:  CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES

Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural
language processing and conversation flow.


# TASK 2:   TIC-TAC-TOE AI

This repository hosts a Python-based Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent. The game is built using Tkinter for the graphical user interface. It features both single-player and multiplayer modes. In single-player mode, the player can challenge an AI opponent based on the minimax algorithm, providing a challenging experience. The game interface is intuitive and visually appealing. Players can restart the game at any point and enjoy seamless gameplay. This project serves as an excellent demonstration of implementing AI algorithms in a classic game scenario. It's a fun and educational project for both beginners and intermediate Python developers interested in game development and AI.
